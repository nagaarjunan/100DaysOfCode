# 100 Days of Code in Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code challenge focused on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)! This repository serves as a logbook of my progress, where I'll be solving DSA problems daily for the next 100 days.

## Motivation 💪

The primary objective of this challenge is to enhance my skills and proficiency in data structures and algorithms. By committing to solving problems daily, I aim to strengthen my problem-solving abilities, gain a deeper understanding of fundamental algorithms, and improve my coding efficiency.

## Rules 📜

1. **Consistency**: I will code and solve DSA problems every day for the next 100 days.
2. **Public Accountability**: I will update my progress daily on GitHub to maintain accountability and track my journey.

## Problem Sources 📚

I will be solving problems from various platforms and sources, including but not limited to:
- LeetCode
- Coding Ninja's
- HackerRank
- GeeksforGeeks

## Structure 🏗️

The repository is organized into daily folders, where each folder contains the solutions to the problems solved on that specific day. Additionally, I'll provide explanations, insights, and any relevant resources alongside the solutions.

## Goal 🎯

By the end of this 100-day journey, I aim to have:
- Improved problem-solving skills in DSA.
- A deeper understanding of common algorithms and data structures.
- Developed a habit of consistent coding practice.

## Connect 🤝

Feel free to connect with me on https://www.linkedin.com/in/nagaarjunan-t/ to discuss coding, DSA, or anything related!

## Acknowledgments 🙏

I'd like to express my gratitude to the coding community, online platforms, and resources that have facilitated my learning journey.
